------Pir8Grabber---------
1) user pays account XX signa enters an encrypted message (game password).
2) account is monitored sees payment came in and is >= XX signa
3) loggs info to file.
-------so far pir8grabber already does the above-------------
NEED TO ADD:  on step 3 above i need to also write a field called  "Status" and a default value of "Wait"




------MY Web App----------
1) monitors above file, and lists accounts in "waiting room" on web interface.
2) user selects his account from waiting room, enters Game Password that he entered when he paid.
3) Play mode starts, change this users "Status" value to "P"
3) game allows him to do things within a set time (30 seconds).
4) if game won, "Status" changes to "W"
5) if game lost, "Status" changes to "L"

-------Pir8Payout app---------   Maybe this can be included in Pir8Grabber?
1) runs every x mins, same time as pir8grabber?
2) reads json/mariaDB
3) anything with a "W" send payment of random signa between xx-xxx signa (setting), change "Status" to "Paid"


STATUS Info

Wait - paid but not played yet.
W - Won the game, gets a random payout
L - Lost the game, no more action needed.
Paid - Script paid out from monitored account a random amount from XX-XXX (based on app setting)
